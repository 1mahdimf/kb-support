KB Support is an easy to use and extremley effective Helpdesk Support System.

== Description ==

An effective Helpdesk / Support desk tool is one that encourages users to find and implement the solution to their queries without actually logging a support ticket and KB Support has been developed to do exactly that!

From the moment your customers begin to log a ticket, KB Support will search your knowledgebase and offer potential solutions based upon the articles that are published on your site.

From your own experience in running a helpdesk for your product(s) you will know that in a busy environment, documenting solutions and making them readily available to your customers always seems to take a back seat. KB Support makes this process much easier and encourages your support desk agents to produce articles when working through resolution of a customers ticket. Those articles are then immediately available on your website, and automatically referenced during a support ticket submission as a potential solution.

Key Features of KB Support include:

* Easily manage and customise submission forms. No coding required, multiple forms can be created and utilised
* Customers do not need an account to create, or manage support tickets. Guest submission is fully supported
* A fully responsive and clean front end design where customers can manage their tickets, including viewing and creating replies
* Integrated Knowledgebase Articles can be easily created and referenced to try and offer solutions without tickets being created
* Ability to *Restrict* individual knowledgebase articles so that only logged in users can access them. Useful for your premium paid products
* A number of useful shortcodes to display submission forms, KB Article lists, ticket history, login/registration forms, profile editor, KB Article search form - and more
* Clean, well written and documented code
* A bunch of hooks and filters for our developer friends
